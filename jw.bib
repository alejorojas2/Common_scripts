	abstract = {Clade 2 of the Fusarium solani species complex contains plant pathogens including Fusarium virguliforme and closely related species Fusarium brasiliense, Fusarium crassistipitatum, Fusarium tucumaniae, which are the primary causal agents of soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS), a significant threat to soybean production. In this study, we developed microsatellite markers from a F. virguliforme genome sequence and applied them to a F. virguliforme population collection of 38 isolates from Michigan and four reference strains from other locations. Of the 225 detected microsatellite loci, 108 loci were suitable for primer design, and 12 of the microsatellite markers were determined to be highly polymorphic, amplifying on average 5.7 alleles per locus. Using these markers, F. virguliforme isolates were partitioned into three distinct clusters, but isolates were not grouped based on relatedness of sampling sites. In addition, 11 out of 12 markers were demonstrated to be highly transferrable to other closely related species.},

	abstract = {Erwinia amylovora is a Gram-negative bacterial plant pathogen in the family Enterobacteriaceae and is the causal agent of fire blight, a devastating disease of apple and pear. Fire blight is traditionally managed by the application of the antibiotic streptomycin during bloom, but this strategy has been challenged by the development and spread of streptomycin resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective, specific, and sustainable control alternatives for fire blight. Antisense antimicrobials are oligomers of nucleic acid homologs with antisense sequence of essential genes in bacteria. The binding of these molecules to the mRNA of essential genes can result in translational repression and antimicrobial effect. Here, we explored the possibility of developing antisense antimicrobials against E. amylovora and using these compounds in fire blight control. We determined that a 10-nucleotide oligomer of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) targeting the start codon region of an essential gene acpP is able to cause complete growth inhibition of E. amylovora. We found that conjugation of cell penetrating peptide (CPP) to PNA is essential for the antimicrobial effect, with CPP1 [(KFF)3K] being the most effective against E. amylovora. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of anti-acpP-CPP1 (2.5 μM) is comparable to the MIC of streptomycin (2 μM). Examination of the antimicrobial mechanisms demonstrated that anti-acpP-CPP1 caused dose-dependent reduction of acpP mRNA in E. amylovora upon treatment and resulted in cell death (bactericidal effect). Anti-acpP-CPP1 (100 μM) is able to effectively limit the pathogen growth on stigmas of apple flowers, although less effective than streptomycin. Finally, unlike streptomycin that does not display any specificity in inhibiting pathogen growth, anti-acpP-CPP1 has more specific antimicrobial effect against E. amylovora. In summary, we demonstrated that PNA–CPP can cause an effective, specific antimicrobial effect against E. amylovora and may provide the basis for a novel approach for fire blight control.},

	abstract = {Fluopyram, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide, was recently registered for use as a soybean seed treatment for management of sudden death syndrome (SDS) caused by Fusarium virguliforme. Although registered and now used commercially, in vitro baseline fungicide sensitivity of F. virguliforme to fluopyram has not yet been established. In this study, the baseline sensitivity of F. virguliforme to fluopyram was determined using in vitro growth of mycelium and germination of conidia assays with two collections of F. virguliforme isolates. A total of 130 and 75 F. virguliforme isolates were tested using the mycelial growth and conidia germination assays, respectively, including a core set of isolates that were tested with both assays. In the mycelial growth inhibition assay, 113 out of 130 isolates (86.9\%) were inhibited 50\% by effective concentrations (EC50) less than 5 µg/ml with a mean EC50 of 3.35 µg/ml. For the conidia germination assay, 73 out of 75 isolates (97\%) were determined to have an estimated EC50 of less than 5 µg/ml with a mean EC50 value of 2.28 µg/ml. In a subset of 20 common isolates that were phenotyped with both assays, conidia germination of F. virguliforme was determined to be more sensitive to fluopyram (mean EC50 = 2.28 µg/ml) than mycelial growth (mean EC50 = 3.35 µg/ml). Hormetic effects were observed in the mycelial growth inhibition assay as 22\% of the isolates demonstrated more growth on medium amended with the lowest fluopyram concentration (1 µg/ml), as compared with the nonfluopyram amended control. It was not possible to determine EC50 values for nine out of 185 isolates (4.8\%), as those isolates were not inhibited by 50\% even at the highest fluopyram concentrations of 100 µg/ml for mycelial growth and 20 µg/ml for conidia germination inhibition assays. On the whole, the F. virguliforme population appears to be sensitive to fluopyram, and this study enables future monitoring of fungicide sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Bacterial etiolation and decline (BED), caused by Acidovorax avenae, is an emerging disease of creeping bentgrass on golf courses in the United States. We performed the first comprehensive analysis of A. avenae on a nationwide collection of turfgrass- and maize-pathogenic A. avenae. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the turfgrass-pathogenic A. avenae in North America are not only highly divergent but also belong to two distinct phylogroups. Both phylogroups specifically infect turfgrass but are more closely related to maize pathogens than to each other. This suggests that, although the disease is only recently reported, it has likely been infecting turfgrass for a long time. To identify a genetic basis for the host specificity, we searched for genes closely related among turfgrass strains but distantly related to their homologs from maize strains. We found a cluster of 11 such genes generated by three ancient recombination events within the type III secretion system (T3SS) pathogenicity island. Ever since the recombination, the cluster has been conserved by strong purifying selection, hinting at its selective importance. Together our analyses suggest that BED is an ancient disease that may owe its host specificity to a highly conserved cluster of 11 T3SS genes.},

	abstract = {The ability to accurately detect and quantify Fusarium virguliforme, the cause of sudden death syndrome (SDS) in soybean, in samples such as plant root tissue and soil is extremely valuable for accurate disease diagnoses and to address research questions. Numerous quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays have been developed for this pathogen but their sensitivity and specificity for F. virguliforme have not been compared. In this study, six qPCR assays were compared in five independent laboratories using the same set of DNA samples from fungi, plants, and soil. Multicopy gene-based assays targeting the ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (IGS) or the mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) showed relatively high sensitivity (limit of detection [LOD] = 0.05 to 5 pg) compared with a single-copy gene (FvTox1)-based assay (LOD = 5 to 50 pg). Specificity varied greatly among assays, with the FvTox1 assay ranking the highest (100\%) and two IGS assays being slightly less specific (95 to 96\%). Another IGS assay targeting four SDS-causing fusaria showed lower specificity (70\%), while the two mtSSU assays were lowest (41 and 47\%). An IGS-based assay showed consistently highest sensitivity (LOD = 0.05 pg) and specificity and inclusivity above 94\% and, thus, is suggested as the most useful qPCR assay for F. virguliforme diagnosis and quantification. However, specificity was also above 94\% in two other assays and their selection for diagnostics and research will depend on objectives, samples, and materials used. These results will facilitate both fundamental and disease management research pertinent to SDS.},

	abstract = {Fusarium virguliforme (syn. F. solani f. sp. glycines) is the primary causal pathogen responsible for soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) in North America. Diagnosis of SDS is difficult because symptoms can be inconsistent or similar to several soybean diseases and disorders. Additionally, quantification and identification of F. virguliforme by traditional dilution plating of soil or ground plant tissue is problematic due to the slow growth rate and plastic morphology of F. virguliforme. Although several real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assays have been developed for F. virguliforme, the performance of those assays does not allow for accurate quantification of F. virguliforme due to the reclassification of the F. solani species complex. In this study, we developed a TaqMan qPCR assay based on the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacer (IGS) region of F. virguliforme. Specificity of the assay was demonstrated by challenging it with genomic DNA of closely related Fusarium spp. and commonly encountered soilborne fungal pathogens. The detection limit of this assay was determined to be 100 fg of pure F. virguliforme genomic DNA or 100 macroconidia in 0.5 g of soil. An exogenous control was multiplexed with the assay to evaluate for PCR inhibition. Target locus copy number variation had minimal impact, with a range of rDNA copy number from 138 to 233 copies per haploid genome, resulting in a minor variation of up to 0.76 cycle threshold values between strains. The qPCR assay is transferable across platforms, as validated on the primary real-time PCR platform used in the Northcentral region of the National Plant Diagnostic Network. A conventional PCR assay for F. virguliforme detection was also developed and validated for use in situations where qPCR is not possible.},
